# TODO:
- consider user input for location prompting for air/weather conditions
- update images to for clarity of conditions
- consider texts to explain air quality conditions
- update UI
- create loading screen
- use more data extracted from API like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- consider adding past condition history and forecasting
- add data visualization (maps, graphs, charts)
